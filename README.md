# Analysis of Taiwan and USA Stocks Data From 2016 to 2021
## Introduction
## Dataset
The data we collected in this article is from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and also is uploaded to [Kaggle community (Taiwan and USA Stocks Data From 2016 to 2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/pentiumlin/taiwan-and-usa-stock-data). In addition, we took two types of incorporations both in Taiwan and the US for examples (exchange-traded fund (ETF) and technology stocks ). For the sake of precise predictions, we proposed here two schemes for analyzing stock price by two types of data pre-processing: the first type is using close price to predict close price; the other one is using stock market indices to predict close price.

## Results
### Machine Learning Workflow
### Models
- LSTM is good at dealing with the stock price data since it is in the form of time series or sequential form.
- XGBoost for Regression is an efficient implementation of gradient boosting, and also can be used for time series forecasting as long as time series datasets are transformed into supervised learning problem.
